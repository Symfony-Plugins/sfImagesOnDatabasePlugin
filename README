How to use it
-------------

This plugin don't required other plugins.

It contains mainly 2 classes :

  * _sfImage_ :
  It consists of image stored on database (jpg, png, bmp, other...).
  * _sfImageTable_ :
  It gives the opportunity to save an image contained in a file in database with an associated name (a reference).

### Store an image

The following code store an image retreived by request with uploaded file.
It is located in a actions.class.php.

          #app/frontend/modules/.../actions.class.php
          $this->form = new sfImageForm();
          $parameters = $request->getParameter($this->form->getName());
          $files = $request->getFiles($this->form->getName());
          $this->form->bind($parameters, $files);
          if ($this->form->isValid())
          {
            $image = sfImageTable::newImage($this->form->getValue('reference'), $this->form->getValue('file'));
            if($image) {
              $this->redirect($image->getUrl());
              return;
            }
          }

Then you can retrieve the image by the url getted from $image->getUrl(). This is like ``{hostname}/images/{name}.{extension}`` as a normal file!

Done, That's it !
